## How does it work?

When you run the script for the first time, it is going to check if it's already installed on the system. If it is not, then it's going to ask if it should be installed.
It checks how much space left in the current disk and by default it's going to place the bin to' 

/SafeBin in root directory.

If you want to set the bin directory to another place, you will be asked so. In order to install this service, you need to run this script with root privilieges.

## Whats the use?

It prevents the risky 'rm' built-in method to remove files instantly.

So you have a safer way to use rm.
